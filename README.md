Conda environments for Machine Learning lectures.

## Usage

First install a **Python 3, 64-bits** [Conda distribution](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python). If you are using Windows make sure you install Anaconda only for your current user, and under a folder that does not contain non-UTF characters (such as **ñ** or **á**). After installing follow the instructions for each particular environment:

* [Deep Learning environments with Keras + Tensorflow + Pytorch](https://github.com/albarji/teaching-environments-deeplearning)
* [Support Vector Machine environments with scikit-learn](SVMs)
* [Text Mining environments with scikit-learn, gensim and spaCy](textmining)
* [Decision Trees and Ensembles environments](https://github.com/albarji/teaching-environments-ensembles)
