Conda environments for Machine Learning lectures.

## Usage

First install a **Python 3** [Conda distribution](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python). If you are using Windows make sure you install Anaconda only for your current user, and under a folder that does not contain non-UTF characters (such as **ñ** or **á**). After installing follow the instructions for each particular environment:

* [Deep Learning environments with Keras + Tensorflow](deeplearning)
* [Support Vector Machine environments with scikit-learn](SVMs)
* [Text Mining environments](textmining)
